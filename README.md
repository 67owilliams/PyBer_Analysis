# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Analyze all rideshare data from January to early May 2019 and create visualisations for the PyBer CEO, V. Isualize.

## Results
Total amount of rides were highest for the Urban city types. Although the Urban city types have the most amount of total drivers with 2405 with the average cost per rides are the cheapest at $24.53, the average fare per driver is $16.57 making it the least compared to the other two city types. The Rural cities have the least amount of rides, total drivers, and total fares, but the average ride is more expensive. It's the opposite case for the Urban cities.

When total fare by city types are compared you can see that the average fares are highest in the Urban cities and lowest in hte Rural areas. The Suburbs are in hte middle.

## Summary
The first disparity that needs to be addressed is the average fare per driver in the urban cities, affecting the bottom line of how much a driver takes home. To balance it out the average fares per ride should be raised. Another idea would be to relocate some of the drivers from the urban areas. There are are surplus of drivers allowing more rides per driver.
